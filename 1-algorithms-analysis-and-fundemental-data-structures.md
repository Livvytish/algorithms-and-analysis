# Week 1 - Algorithms analysis and fundemental data structures

## 1. What is an algorithm and what are its characteristics? Are algorithms language-specific? Explain the derivation of the term “algorithm.”

- **What is an algorithm**
  - Sequence of unambiguous instructions
  - Solves a problem
  - Obtains required output
  - Based on any legitimate input in a finite amount of time

- Algorithms are **not** language specific

- Comes from the latinisation of the name of some Arabic man :smile:

**2. Given that the official purpose of the U.S. patent system is the promotion of the “useful arts,” do you think algorithms are patentable in this scountry? Should they be?**



**3. a. Write down the steps for installing a television set in your home with the precision required from an algorithm’s description.**

**b. Write down the steps for preparing tea with the precision required by an algorithm.**

**4. Write an algorithm for sorting integer numbers in ascending order using any sorting technique. For example, the unsorted numbers are 23, 45, 12, 37, 11, 56 and the sorted numbers in ascending order are 11, 12, 23, 37, 45, 56.**
