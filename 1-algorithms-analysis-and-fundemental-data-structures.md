**1. What is an algorithm and what are its characteristics? Are algorithms language-specific? Explain the derivation of the term “algorithm.”**

- An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time
  - **Important takeaways**
    - Sequence of unambiguous instructions
    - Solves a problem
    - Obtains required output
    - Based on any legitimate input in a finite amount of time
- Algorithms are not language specific

**2. Given that the official purpose of the U.S. patent system is the promotion of the “useful arts,” do you think algorithms are patentable in this country? Should they be?**

**3. a. Write down the steps for installing a television set in your home with the precision required from an algorithm’s description.**

**b. Write down the steps for preparing tea with the precision required by an algorithm.**

**4. Write an algorithm for sorting integer numbers in ascending order using any sorting technique. For example, the unsorted numbers are 23, 45, 12, 37, 11, 56 and the sorted numbers in ascending order are 11, 12, 23, 37, 45, 56.**
